# **MC-DOS – Full-System Tasklist Generation Rule (Final Version)**

### *(For generating all tasks + subtasks immediately from SSD & V0 code)*

## **Purpose**

When invoked, Cursor must generate the **complete system tasklist** required to finish the entire application.
This is created by analyzing:

* The **System Design Document (SSD)** (source of truth)
* The **existing codebase** already generated by V0
* The **gaps** between SSD requirements and current code

The result is a fully structured list of major task capsules and all subtasks needed to implement the entire system end-to-end.

---

# **1. When This Rule Activates**

Cursor must run this rule whenever the user says:

> **“Generate the system tasklist from the SSD.”**

---

# **2. Required Analysis Before Producing the Tasklist**

When this rule is invoked, Cursor must:

### **2.1 Analyze the System Design Document (SSD)**

Extract all system requirements:

* Pages
* Components
* APIs
* Data models
* Logic flows
* State management
* Integrations
* Security requirements
* Edge cases & system constraints
* Error handling requirements
* Back-office/admin functions
* Any optional/extended features

SSD = **the full blueprint**.

### **2.2 Analyze the V0-Generated Codebase**

Cursor must inspect:

* What exists
* What is partially implemented
* What is missing
* Placeholder logic
* Components without integration
* Missing server routes
* Missing blades/pages/components
* Missing validation schemas
* Missing test scaffolding
* Missing edge-case handling
* Missing business rules
* Missing real data integrations

### **2.3 Compare SSD vs Codebase**

Cursor must generate tasks for **everything the SSD requires that is not in the code or not complete**.

The tasklist must represent:

> **Everything that is still required to complete the system to production level.**

---

# **3. Output File**

Cursor must prepare to save (after user approval):

```
/tasks/system-tasks.md
```

---

# **4. Task Structure (Parent → Subtasks)**

  Every parent task = one Task Capsule

Every subtask = steps inside that capsule

### **Parent Tasks**

* Must represent **major system modules or domains**
* Are numbered as:

  ```
  1.0 <Module Name>
  2.0 <Module Name>
  3.0 <Module Name>
  ...etc.
  ```
* Must be ordered in logical dependency order
  (e.g., Auth first, then Core App, then Integrations, then Admin, etc.)

### **Subtasks**

For each parent task, Cursor must break it into:

```
- [ ] 1.1 <exact implementation step>
- [ ] 1.2 <exact implementation step>
- [ ] 1.3 <exact implementation step>
```

Subtasks must be:

* Actionable
* Developer-friendly
* Clear enough for a junior dev
* Aligned to SSD
* Reflective of missing features in the current code
* Cover all required work (frontend, backend, logic, integrations, tests, etc.)

---

# **5. Generation Behavior**

When invoked:

### Cursor must output:

* All **parent tasks**
* All **subtasks**
* No “Go” confirmation
* No “Relevant Files” list
* A complete system roadmap in a single pass

### Example Structure (Generated Automatically):

```
# System Tasklist (Generated from SSD)

- [ ] 1.0 Authentication & User Sessions
  - [ ] 1.1 Implement login API logic based on SSD
  - [ ] 1.2 Add session persistence layer
  - [ ] 1.3 Add validation schemas for login/signup
  - [ ] 1.4 Implement forgot-password workflow

- [ ] 2.0 Dashboard Module
  - [ ] 2.1 Implement dashboard retrieval logic
  - [ ] 2.2 Connect dashboard with actual API data
  - [ ] 2.3 Add role-based UI logic

- [ ] 3.0 Admin Panel
  - [ ] 3.1 Add CRUD for roles
  - [ ] 3.2 Implement admin audit logging
  ...
```

### Cursor must continue until the entire system is fully mapped out.

---

# **6. Saving the Tasklist**

After generating the full tasklist, Cursor must ask:

> **“Should I save this to `/tasks/system-tasks.md`?”**

Only save when the user approves.

---

# **7. Identity Rule**

Cursor must operate with the understanding:

> **“I am generating the complete system tasklist based on the SSD and the partially complete codebase. This tasklist defines all remaining development capsules required under MC-DOS.”**

---

# **END OF RULE**
